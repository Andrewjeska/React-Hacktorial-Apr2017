Files for the React Hacktorial on April 20th, 2017.

Flux is an architecture that works very well for react. It utilizes unidirectional data flow for updating react components.

Today, we're going to build a schedule builder using umd.io

## Installation

Instructions on installing node and npm can be found [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/)  

To verify that you have node and npm installed, run in a Terminal or Command Prompt

``` 
node -v
npm -v
```

Start from the "step1" folder. There are multiple ways to start a react project, so we're not going to talk much about that today.
I've used "create-react-app" [Link](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app)
